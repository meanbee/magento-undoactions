Meanbee Undo Actions
=====================

Undo actions allow your customers to undo adding and removing items from their carts. These undo actions improve the overall user experience by giving the customer the ability to instantly undo-mistakes without any hassle.

For example, if a customer adds a configurable product, and deletes the product from their cart by accident, the customer can easily undo this by hitting the Undo link, which will restore the delete item along with the configuration.
